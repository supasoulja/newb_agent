"""
Kai's sleep cycle — shutdown consolidation and welcome-back message.

When Kai shuts down, she doesn't just stop. She goes to sleep:
  1. Writes a welcome-back message to herself (what was happening, what matters)
  2. HQ re-embed runs (handled separately in embed.py)

On boot, the welcome-back message is loaded and injected into the first context
block so Kai has continuity — she wakes up knowing where she left off.

The welcome-back message is stored as a plain text file in MEMORY_DIR.
Human-readable, inspectable, ~1000 chars max.
